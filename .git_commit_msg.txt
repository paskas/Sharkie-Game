refactor: conversion of all character loops to requestAnimationFrame

- runAnimate, runMovement, runShoot converted to requestAnimationFrame
- all run functions now start recursively instead of via repeated external calls
- clearAllIntervals adjusted
- new method startCharacterLoop introduced in Character to start all loops centrally
- startCharacterLoop is now called at the end of Level.initLevel as soon as the character is initialized
- fixed issue where shooting no longer worked after the damage phase
